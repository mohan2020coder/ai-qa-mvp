Here's an example test plan for the task management web app:

1. Unit tests:
	* Test that the CreateTask handler correctly creates and saves a new task to the database.
	* Test that the GetTasks handler correctly retrieves all tasks from the database.
	* Test that the GetTask handler correctly retrieves a specific task by ID from the database.
	* Test that the UpdateTaskStatus handler correctly updates the status of a task in the database.
2. API contract tests:
	* Use curl to send POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests to the app's endpoints and verify the response.
	* For example, to create a new task, you can use the following command: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/tasks -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Task 1", "description": "This is a test task"}'`.
	* To get all tasks, you can use the following command: `curl http://localhost:8080/tasks`.
	* To update the status of a task by ID, you can use the following command: `curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/tasks/{id}/status -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"status": "Completed"}'`.
3. Integration tests:
	* Test that the app correctly handles invalid requests (e.g., sending a POST request with an empty JSON body).
	* Test that the app correctly handles errors when saving or retrieving tasks from the database.
4. End-to-end tests:
	* Use a tool like Selenium to test the app's user interface and verify that it behaves as expected.
5. Continuous Integration (CI) outline:
	* Set up a CI pipeline that automatically runs the unit, API contract, integration, and end-to-end tests whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
	* Use a tool like GitHub Actions or CircleCI to automate the testing process.
	* Configure the CI pipeline to send notifications when tests fail or succeed.

Here's an example of runnable Go tests for the CreateTask handler:
```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"net/http"
	"testing"
)

func TestCreateTask(t *testing.T) {
	// Set up a test server
	server := httptest.NewServer(http.HandlerFunc(CreateTask))
	defer server.Close()

	// Create a new task
	task := Task{Title: "Task 1", Description: "This is a test task"}
	jsonBody, _ := json.Marshal(task)

	// Send a POST request to the app's endpoint
	resp, err := http.Post(server.URL+"/tasks", "application/json", bytes.NewBuffer(jsonBody))
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("Error sending POST request: %v", err)
	}

	// Verify that the task was created correctly
	var createdTask Task
	err = json.Unmarshal(resp.Body, &createdTask)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("Error unmarshaling response body: %v", err)
	}
	if createdTask.Title != task.Title || createdTask.Description != task.Description {
		t.Errorf("Expected task to be created with title '%s' and description '%s', but got '%s' and '%s' instead", task.Title, task.Description, createdTask.Title, createdTask.Description)
	}
}
```
