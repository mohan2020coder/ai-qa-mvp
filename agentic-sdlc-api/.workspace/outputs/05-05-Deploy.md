Here's a minimal deployment plan for the task management web app:

1. Docker build + run commands:
```bash
# Build the Go backend image
docker build -t go-backend .

# Run the Go backend container
docker run -p 8080:8080 go-backend
```
2. A simple docker-compose for app + db:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: tasks
```
3. A lightweight CI workflow (GitHub Actions) as YAML:
```yaml
name: Test and Deploy
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          go test ./...
  deploy:
    needs: [test]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t go-backend .
          docker tag go-backend user/go-backend:latest
          docker push user/go-backend:latest
```
4. Basic observability (health, logs):

To monitor the health of the app and log any errors that occur during deployment, you can use a tool like Prometheus and Grafana. Here's an example configuration for Prometheus:
```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'go-backend'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
```
And here's an example configuration for Grafana:
```yaml
datasources:
  - name: Prometheus
    type: prometheus
    url: http://localhost:9090
    access: proxy
    basicAuth: true
    withCredentials: true
    jsonData:
      timeInterval: "15s"
```
Note that this is just a minimal example, and you may need to modify the configuration files to fit your specific needs.
