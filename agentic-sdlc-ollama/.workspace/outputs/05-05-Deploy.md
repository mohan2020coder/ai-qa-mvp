Here is a minimal deployment plan for the task management web app, including Docker build and run commands, a simple `docker-compose` file for app + db, and a lightweight CI workflow (GitHub Actions) as YAML:

1. **Docker Build and Run Commands**
```bash
# Build the backend service
$ docker build -t my-task-management-app .

# Run the backend service with Docker Compose
$ docker-compose up -d
```
2. **`docker-compose.yml` File**
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: tasks
```
3. **CI Workflow (GitHub Actions)**
```yaml
name: Deploy to Docker Hub

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        env:
          IMAGE_NAME: my-task-management-app
          IMAGE_TAG: ${{ github.sha }}
        run: |
          docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG .
          docker push $IMAGE_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG
```
This deployment plan includes the following features:

* **Docker Build and Run Commands**: These commands are used to build and run the backend service using Docker. The `docker-compose` file is used to define the dependencies between the app and db services.
* **`docker-compose.yml` File**: This file defines the services (app and db) and their dependencies, as well as the environment variables for the Postgres database.
* **CI Workflow (GitHub Actions)**: This workflow is used to deploy the Docker image to Docker Hub on push events to the `main` branch. The workflow uses the `actions/checkout@v2` action to checkout the code, and then builds and pushes the Docker image using the `docker build` and `docker push` commands.

This minimal deployment plan provides a basic structure for deploying the task management web app with Docker and GitHub Actions. It includes the necessary components for building and running the backend service, as well as defining the dependencies between services and environment variables for the Postgres database.
