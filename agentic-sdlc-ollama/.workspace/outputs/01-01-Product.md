Product Requirements: Task Management Web App
-------------------------------------------

### Problem Statement

The problem we are trying to solve is the lack of a simple and efficient task management system for individuals and teams. Our solution will provide a web-based platform that allows users to easily manage their tasks, set reminders, and collaborate with others in real-time.

### Personas

* **User:** A user who wants to manage their tasks effectively and efficiently.
* **Team Lead:** A team lead who wants to manage a group of tasks for their team and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

### User Stories (As a … I want … so that …)

1. As a user, I want to be able to create new tasks and add them to my task list.
2. As a user, I want to be able to view my task list and see the status of each task.
3. As a user, I want to be able to set reminders for each task so that I don't forget about them.
4. As a team lead, I want to be able to create new tasks for my team and assign them to specific members.
5. As a team lead, I want to be able to view the status of each task and ensure that everyone is on track with their work.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. The system should allow users to create new tasks and add them to their task list.
2. The system should allow users to view their task list and see the status of each task.
3. The system should allow users to set reminders for each task so that they don't forget about them.
4. The system should allow team leads to create new tasks for their team and assign them to specific members.
5. The system should allow team leads to view the status of each task and ensure that everyone is on track with their work.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. The system should be scalable and able to handle a large number of users and tasks.
2. The system should have good performance and be able to handle multiple requests at the same time.
3. The system should have good security measures in place to protect user data.
4. The system should have good error handling and be able to recover from unexpected errors.
5. The system should have good documentation and support for users and developers.

### Containerization with Docker

The system will be containerized using Docker, which will allow us to easily deploy the application on different environments and platforms. We will also include a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.
