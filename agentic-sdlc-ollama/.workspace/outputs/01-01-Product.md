<think>
We are building a task management web app.
 The backend will be a Go HTTP service with endpoints for health check and CRUD operations on tasks.
 We'll use either React or Svelte for the frontend, keeping it simple.
 For authentication, we'll keep it minimal (basic session or token).
 Choose SQLite or Postgres for the database; let's choose SQLite for simplicity in this context.
 Containerize with Docker and include CI suggestion.

 Let's break down into product requirements:

 1. Problem Statement
    We need a task management application that allows users to create, read, update, delete tasks and check their health status.

 2. Personas
    - End User: A user who wants to manage personal or team tasks.
    - Administrator: An admin who might set up the system (though minimal in this spec).

 3. User Stories

    a) As an end user, I want to be able to log in so that I can access my task list and perform CRUD operations on tasks.

    b) As an end user, I want to view all my tasks with their details (title, description, due date, status) so that I can keep track of what needs to be done.

    c) As an end user, I want to create a new task by providing a title and description so that I can add items to my todo list.

    d) As an end user, I want to update the details (title, description, due date, status) of an existing task so that I can modify it as needed.

    e) As an end user, I want to delete tasks that are no longer relevant or completed so that my task list remains organized and manageable.

 4. Acceptance Criteria

    a) Login:
        - The system should allow the user to log in with a username and password.
        - Upon successful login, the session (or token) should be stored securely (e.g., in memory for this simple app or using JWT).
        - The user should be able to access their tasks only after logging in.

    b) Task List:
        - After logging in, the end user should see a list of all tasks associated with their account.
        - Each task should display: title, description, due date (if provided), and status.

    c) Create Task:
        - The end user should be able to click a button to create a new task.
        - A form should appear for the user to enter title and description. Optionally, they can set a due date and initial status.
        - Upon submitting the form, the task is created and added to the list.

    d) Update Task:
        - The end user should be able to click an edit button on any task in the list.
        - A modal or separate page with a form for updating the task details (title, description, due date, status) should appear.
        - Upon submitting the updated details, the task is modified and the list reflects the change.

    e) Delete Task:
        - The end user should be able to click a delete button on any task in the list.
        - A confirmation modal or direct action (with caution) should prevent accidental deletion.
        - After deletion, the task is removed from the list.

 5. Non-Functional Requirements

    a) Performance: 
        - The application should respond within 1 second for CRUD operations and health check under normal load.

    b) Security:
        - Use secure methods to handle authentication (e.g., JWT with proper signing or session management).
        - Protect against common web vulnerabilities such as XSS, CSRF, SQL injection (though SQLite might be simpler).

    c) Usability:
        - The UI should be intuitive and user-friendly.
        - Provide clear feedback for actions performed.

    d) Reliability:
        - The backend service must have a /health endpoint to check the status of the application.
        - Tasks data should persist even after restarts (if using SQLite, it's file-based; if Postgres, we'd use a database).

    e) Maintainability:
        - Code should be well-structured and commented for easy understanding and future modifications.

 6. Additional Requirements

    - Containerization: The app must run inside a Docker container.
    - CI Suggestion: We can suggest setting up GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to build and test the application automatically.

 However, note that we are keeping it minimal so let's focus on the core functionality.

 Let me write these requirements in a structured way.

# Task Management Web App Product Requirements

## Problem Statement
We need to create a simple task management web application that allows users to manage their tasks through basic CRUD operations. The app should provide an intuitive interface for viewing, creating, editing and deleting tasks while ensuring data persistence and security.

## Personas
1. **End User**: A user who wants to manage personal or team tasks with minimal complexity.
2. **Administrator**: An admin who might set up the system (though minimal in this spec).

## Top 5 User Stories

### Story 1: Task Creation
As an end user, I want to create a new task by providing a title and description so that I can add items to my todo list.

### Story 2: Task Retrieval
As an end user, I want to view all my tasks with their details (title, description, due date, status) so that I can keep track of what needs to be done.

### Story 3: Task Editing
As an end user, I want to update the details (title, description, due -date, status) of an existing task so that I can modify it as needed.

### Story 4: Task Deletion
As an end user, I want to delete tasks that are no longer relevant or completed so that my task list remains organized and manageable.

### Story 5: Authentication
As an end user, I want to log in with a username and password so that I can securely access the application's features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Task Creation**
   - The system shall allow creation of new tasks through a form interface.
   - Each task must have at least title and description fields.
   - Tasks should be stored persistently using SQLite database.
   - Upon successful creation, the task should appear in the user's task list.

2. **Task Retrieval**
   - All tasks created by the user shall be displayed on the dashboard.
   - The display shall include: task title, description, due date (if provided), and status.
   - Tasks can be filtered/sorted by status or due date if needed.

3. **Task Editing**
   - Each task in the list shall have an edit button/icon.
   - Clicking the edit button shall open a modal with editable fields for that task.
   - Changes to tasks shall update the database and reflect immediately on the dashboard.
   - The system shall prevent editing of non-existent tasks.

4. **Task Deletion**
   - Each task in the list shall have a delete button/icon.
   - Clicking the delete button shall trigger a confirmation modal.
   - After confirmation, the task shall be removed from SQLite database and no longer displayed.
   - The system shall log deletion attempts for auditing purposes (if required).

5. **Authentication**
   - There shall be a login page separate from the main dashboard.
   - Login requires username/password combination.
   - Upon successful authentication, the user should be redirected to their task list.
   - Unauthenticated users shall not have access to any task-related functionality.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Task operations (CRUD) must complete within 500ms under normal load
   - Health check endpoint response time < 200ms

2. **Security**
   - All endpoints should require authentication except /health and login page
   - Passwords shall be stored hashed in SQLite database
   - Basic session management using JWT tokens with expiration (default 1 hour)
   - Cross-site scripting protection enabled by default

3. **Usability**
   - Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet and desktop screens
   - Intuitive navigation between dashboard and task operations
   - Clear error messages for invalid inputs or authentication failures
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (delete)

4. **Reliability**
   - Data consistency maintained across all operations
   - SQLite database transactions enabled by default
   - Error handling for common scenarios:
     - Duplicate task titles
     - Empty fields during creation/editing
     - Authentication expiration

5. **Maintainability**
   - Clean, well-structured code following RESTful principles
   - Consistent API response formats (JSON with proper error codes)
   - Docker container should be lightweight and efficient
   - CI/CD pipeline suggestion included in documentation

## Additional Requirements

1. The application shall use Go for backend development and React for frontend.
2. All endpoints must return appropriate HTTP status codes:
   - 200 OK for successful GET requests
   - 201 Created for successful POST requests
   - 400 Bad Request for invalid inputs
   - 401 Unauthorized for unauthenticated access
   - 409 Conflict for duplicate entries or other conflicts

3. The system shall include a /health endpoint that returns:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "uptime": "...",
     "db_status": "healthy"
   }
   ```

4. All user interactions should be logged (if required) with proper timestamps.

5. Documentation requirements:
   - Include Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for local development
   - Provide CI/CD pipeline example using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
