Product Requirements: Task Management Web App
-------------------------------------------

### Problem Statement

The problem we are trying to solve is the lack of a simple and efficient task management system for individuals and teams. Our solution will provide a web-based platform that allows users to easily manage their tasks, set reminders, and collaborate with others in real-time.

### Personas

* **User:** A user who wants to manage their tasks effectively and efficiently.
* **Team Lead:** A team lead who wants to manage a group of tasks for their team and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

### User Stories (As a … I want … so that …)

1. As a user, I want to be able to create new tasks and add them to my task list.
2. As a user, I want to be able to view my task list and see the status of each task.
3. As a user, I want to be able to set reminders for each task so that I don't forget about them.
4. As a team lead, I want to be able to create new tasks for my team and assign them to specific members.
5. As a team lead, I want to be able to view the status of each task and ensure that everyone is on track with their work.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. The system should allow users to create new tasks and add them to their task list.
2. The system should allow users to view their task list and see the status of each task.
3. The system should allow users to set reminders for each task so that they don't forget about them.
4. The system should allow team leads to create new tasks for their team and assign them to specific members.
5. The system should allow team leads to view the status of each task and ensure that everyone is on track with their work.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. The system should be scalable and able to handle a large number of users and tasks.
2. The system should have good performance and be able to handle multiple requests at the same time.
3. The system should have good security measures in place to protect user data.
4. The system should have good error handling and be able to recover from unexpected errors.
5. The system should have good documentation and support for users and developers.

### Containerization with Docker

The system will be containerized using Docker, which will allow us to easily deploy the application on different environments and platforms. We will also include a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.

Context: Task Management Web App
=============================

### Overview

The task management web app is designed to provide a simple and efficient way for individuals and teams to manage their tasks, set reminders, and collaborate in real-time. The system will be built using Go as the backend language, React or Svelte for the frontend framework, basic session or token authentication, SQLite or Postgres for the database, and Docker for containerization.

### Components

1. **Backend**: The backend component will handle all the server-side logic, including CRUD operations for tasks, user authentication, and task reminders. It will be built using Go and will communicate with the frontend component through RESTful APIs.
2. **Frontend**: The frontend component will provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system. It will be built using React or Svelte and will communicate with the backend component through RESTful APIs.
3. **Auth**: The auth component will handle user authentication and authorization. It will be built using basic session or token authentication and will communicate with the backend component through RESTful APIs.
4. **DB**: The DB component will store all the data for the system, including tasks, users, and reminders. It will be built using SQLite or Postgres and will communicate with the backend component through SQL queries.
5. **Containerization**: The system will be containerized using Docker, which will allow us to easily deploy the application on different environments and platforms. We will also include a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.

### Sequence for Key Flows

1. User creates a new task in the frontend component and submits it to the backend component through RESTful APIs.
2. The backend component validates the input data, creates a new task in the DB component, and sends a response back to the frontend component.
3. The frontend component displays the new task in the user's task list.
4. User sets a reminder for the task in the frontend component and submits it to the backend component through RESTful APIs.
5. The backend component updates the reminder date in the DB component and sends a response back to the frontend component.
6. The frontend component displays the updated reminder date for the task.
7. Team lead creates a new task for their team in the frontend component and submits it to the backend component through RESTful APIs.
8. The backend component validates the input data, creates a new task in the DB component, and sends a response back to the frontend component.
9. The frontend component displays the new task in the team lead's task list.
10. Team lead sets a reminder for the task in the frontend component and submits it to the backend component through RESTful APIs.
11. The backend component updates the reminder date in the DB component and sends a response back to the frontend component.
12. The frontend component displays the updated reminder date for the task.

### API Spec Outline

The following is an outline of the RESTful APIs that will be used by the system:

1. **GET /tasks**: Retrieves a list of all tasks for the current user or team lead.
2. **POST /tasks**: Creates a new task and adds it to the DB component.
3. **PUT /tasks/{task_id}**: Updates an existing task in the DB component.
4. **DELETE /tasks/{task_id}**: Deletes an existing task from the DB component.
5. **GET /reminders**: Retrieves a list of all reminders for the current user or team lead.
6. **POST /reminders**: Creates a new reminder and adds it to the DB component.
7. **PUT /reminders/{reminder_id}**: Updates an existing reminder in the DB component.
8. **DELETE /reminders/{reminder_id}**: Deletes an existing reminder from the DB component.

### Data Model

The following is a high-level data model for the system:

1. Tasks: Each task will have a unique ID, title, description, status (e.g., "in progress", "completed"), and reminder date.
2. Reminders: Each reminder will have a unique ID, task ID, user ID, and reminder date.
3. Users: Each user will have a unique ID, username, email, and password.
4. Teams: Each team will have a unique ID, name, and list of members (user IDs).

### Tradeoffs

1. **Scalability**: The system will be designed to scale horizontally by adding more instances of the backend component as needed.
2. **Performance**: The system will use caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce the load on the DB component.
3. **Security**: The system will use basic session or token authentication to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Error Handling**: The system will have good error handling in place to recover from unexpected errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.
5. **Documentation**: The system will have good documentation and support for users and developers, including API documentation and user guides.

# 04-Test Output (generated in 6m2.643s)


Here is a compact test plan and example tests for the task management web app:

1. Unit Tests (Go):
	* Test that the backend service can handle HTTP requests correctly.
	* Test that the database connection is established successfully.
	* Test that the CRUD operations on tasks are working as expected.
2. API Contract Tests (curl examples):
	* Test that the `/health` endpoint returns a 200 status code and "OK" response body.
	* Test that the `/tasks` endpoint returns a list of tasks for a specific user ID.
	* Test that the `/tasks/create`, `/tasks/update`, and `/tasks/delete` endpoints can create, update, and delete tasks correctly.
3. CI Outline:
	* Set up a GitHub Actions pipeline to deploy the Docker image to Docker Hub.
	* Configure the pipeline to run on push events for the `main` branch.
	* Use the `docker build` and `docker push` commands in the pipeline to build and deploy the Docker image.

Here are some example tests:

1. Unit Tests (Go):
```go
package main

import (
	"testing"
)

func TestBackendService(t *testing.T) {
	// Set up a test server
	server := httptest.NewServer(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "OK")
	}))
	defer server.Close()

	// Test that the server can handle HTTP requests correctly
	resp, err := http.Get(server.URL + "/health")
	if err != nil {
		t.Errorf("Failed to get response: %v", err)
	}
	if resp.StatusCode != 200 {
		t.Errorf("Expected status code 200, got %d", resp.StatusCode)
	}
	body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	if string(body) != "OK" {
		t.Errorf("Expected response body 'OK', got '%s'", body)
	}
}
```
2. API Contract Tests (curl examples):
```bash
# Test that the /health endpoint returns a 200 status code and "OK" response body
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/health
{"status":"OK"}

# Test that the /tasks endpoint returns a list of tasks for a specific user ID
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/tasks?user_id=1
[{"id":1,"title":"Task 1","description":"Description 1","status":"active","reminder_date":"2023-03-15T14:30:00Z"},{"id":2,"title":"Task 2","description":"Description 2","status":"completed","reminder_date":"2023-03-16T14:30:00Z"}]

# Test that the /tasks/create endpoint can create a new task correctly
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/tasks/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Task 3","description":"Description 3","status":"active","reminder_date":"2023-03-17T14:30:00Z"}'
{"id":3,"title":"Task 3","description":"Description 3","status":"active","reminder_date":"2023-03-17T14:30:00Z"}

# Test that the /tasks/update endpoint can update a task correctly
$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/tasks/update \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":3,"title":"Task 3 updated","description":"Description 3 updated","status":"completed","reminder_date":"2023-03-17T14:30:00Z"}'
{"id":3,"title":"Task 3 updated","description":"Description 3 updated","status":"completed","reminder_date":"2023-03-17T14:30:00Z"}

# Test that the /tasks/delete endpoint can delete a task correctly
$ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/tasks/delete?id=3
{"message":"Task deleted successfully"}
```
3. CI Outline:
```yaml
name: Deploy to Docker Hub

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        env:
          IMAGE_NAME: my-task-management-app
          IMAGE_TAG: ${{ github.sha }}
        run: |
          docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG .
          docker push $IMAGE_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG
```


# 05-Deploy Output (generated in 3m26.072s)

Here is a minimal deployment plan for the task management web app, including Docker build and run commands, a simple `docker-compose` file for app + db, and a lightweight CI workflow (GitHub Actions) as YAML:

1. **Docker Build and Run Commands**
```bash
# Build the backend service
$ docker build -t my-task-management-app .

# Run the backend service with Docker Compose
$ docker-compose up -d
```
2. **`docker-compose.yml` File**
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: tasks
```
3. **CI Workflow (GitHub Actions)**
```yaml
name: Deploy to Docker Hub

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        env:
          IMAGE_NAME: my-task-management-app
          IMAGE_TAG: ${{ github.sha }}
        run: |
          docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG .
          docker push $IMAGE_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG
```
This deployment plan includes the following features:

* **Docker Build and Run Commands**: These commands are used to build and run the backend service using Docker. The `docker-compose` file is used to define the dependencies between the app and db services.
* **`docker-compose.yml` File**: This file defines the services (app and db) and their dependencies, as well as the environment variables for the Postgres database.
* **CI Workflow (GitHub Actions)**: This workflow is used to deploy the Docker image to Docker Hub on push events to the `main` branch. The workflow uses the `actions/checkout@v2` action to checkout the code, and then builds and pushes the Docker image using the `docker build` and `docker push` commands.

This minimal deployment plan provides a basic structure for deploying the task management web app with Docker and GitHub Actions. It includes the necessary components for building and running the backend service, as well as defining the dependencies between services and environment variables for the Postgres database.
