# 01-Product Output (generated in 9m9.226s)

<think>
We are building a task management web app.
 The backend will be a Go HTTP service with endpoints for health check and CRUD operations on tasks.
 We'll use either React or Svelte for the frontend, keeping it simple.
 For authentication, we'll keep it minimal (basic session or token).
 Choose SQLite or Postgres for the database; let's choose SQLite for simplicity in this context.
 Containerize with Docker and include CI suggestion.

 Let's break down into product requirements:

 1. Problem Statement
    We need a task management application that allows users to create, read, update, delete tasks and check their health status.

 2. Personas
    - End User: A user who wants to manage personal or team tasks.
    - Administrator: An admin who might set up the system (though minimal in this spec).

 3. User Stories

    a) As an end user, I want to be able to log in so that I can access my task list and perform CRUD operations on tasks.

    b) As an end user, I want to view all my tasks with their details (title, description, due date, status) so that I can keep track of what needs to be done.

    c) As an end user, I want to create a new task by providing a title and description so that I can add items to my todo list.

    d) As an end user, I want to update the details (title, description, due date, status) of an existing task so that I can modify it as needed.

    e) As an end user, I want to delete tasks that are no longer relevant or completed so that my task list remains organized and manageable.

 4. Acceptance Criteria

    a) Login:
        - The system should allow the user to log in with a username and password.
        - Upon successful login, the session (or token) should be stored securely (e.g., in memory for this simple app or using JWT).
        - The user should be able to access their tasks only after logging in.

    b) Task List:
        - After logging in, the end user should see a list of all tasks associated with their account.
        - Each task should display: title, description, due date (if provided), and status.

    c) Create Task:
        - The end user should be able to click a button to create a new task.
        - A form should appear for the user to enter title and description. Optionally, they can set a due date and initial status.
        - Upon submitting the form, the task is created and added to the list.

    d) Update Task:
        - The end user should be able to click an edit button on any task in the list.
        - A modal or separate page with a form for updating the task details (title, description, due date, status) should appear.
        - Upon submitting the updated details, the task is modified and the list reflects the change.

    e) Delete Task:
        - The end user should be able to click a delete button on any task in the list.
        - A confirmation modal or direct action (with caution) should prevent accidental deletion.
        - After deletion, the task is removed from the list.

 5. Non-Functional Requirements

    a) Performance: 
        - The application should respond within 1 second for CRUD operations and health check under normal load.

    b) Security:
        - Use secure methods to handle authentication (e.g., JWT with proper signing or session management).
        - Protect against common web vulnerabilities such as XSS, CSRF, SQL injection (though SQLite might be simpler).

    c) Usability:
        - The UI should be intuitive and user-friendly.
        - Provide clear feedback for actions performed.

    d) Reliability:
        - The backend service must have a /health endpoint to check the status of the application.
        - Tasks data should persist even after restarts (if using SQLite, it's file-based; if Postgres, we'd use a database).

    e) Maintainability:
        - Code should be well-structured and commented for easy understanding and future modifications.

 6. Additional Requirements

    - Containerization: The app must run inside a Docker container.
    - CI Suggestion: We can suggest setting up GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to build and test the application automatically.

 However, note that we are keeping it minimal so let's focus on the core functionality.

 Let me write these requirements in a structured way.

# Task Management Web App Product Requirements

## Problem Statement
We need to create a simple task management web application that allows users to manage their tasks through basic CRUD operations. The app should provide an intuitive interface for viewing, creating, editing and deleting tasks while ensuring data persistence and security.

## Personas
1. **End User**: A user who wants to manage personal or team tasks with minimal complexity.
2. **Administrator**: An admin who might set up the system (though minimal in this spec).

## Top 5 User Stories

### Story 1: Task Creation
As an end user, I want to create a new task by providing a title and description so that I can add items to my todo list.

### Story 2: Task Retrieval
As an end user, I want to view all my tasks with their details (title, description, due date, status) so that I can keep track of what needs to be done.

### Story 3: Task Editing
As an end user, I want to update the details (title, description, due -date, status) of an existing task so that I can modify it as needed.

### Story 4: Task Deletion
As an end user, I want to delete tasks that are no longer relevant or completed so that my task list remains organized and manageable.

### Story 5: Authentication
As an end user, I want to log in with a username and password so that I can securely access the application's features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Task Creation**
   - The system shall allow creation of new tasks through a form interface.
   - Each task must have at least title and description fields.
   - Tasks should be stored persistently using SQLite database.
   - Upon successful creation, the task should appear in the user's task list.

2. **Task Retrieval**
   - All tasks created by the user shall be displayed on the dashboard.
   - The display shall include: task title, description, due date (if provided), and status.
   - Tasks can be filtered/sorted by status or due date if needed.

3. **Task Editing**
   - Each task in the list shall have an edit button/icon.
   - Clicking the edit button shall open a modal with editable fields for that task.
   - Changes to tasks shall update the database and reflect immediately on the dashboard.
   - The system shall prevent editing of non-existent tasks.

4. **Task Deletion**
   - Each task in the list shall have a delete button/icon.
   - Clicking the delete button shall trigger a confirmation modal.
   - After confirmation, the task shall be removed from SQLite database and no longer displayed.
   - The system shall log deletion attempts for auditing purposes (if required).

5. **Authentication**
   - There shall be a login page separate from the main dashboard.
   - Login requires username/password combination.
   - Upon successful authentication, the user should be redirected to their task list.
   - Unauthenticated users shall not have access to any task-related functionality.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Task operations (CRUD) must complete within 500ms under normal load
   - Health check endpoint response time < 200ms

   - 409 Conflict for duplicate entries or other conflicts

3. The system shall include a /health endpoint that returns:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "uptime": "...",
     "db_status": "healthy"
   }
   ```

4. All user interactions should be logged (if required) with proper timestamps.

# 02-Design Output (generated in 1m20.995s)




# 03-Code Output (generated in 8m19.747s)

<think>
We are going to build a simple task management web app.
 Steps:
 1. Backend in Go with endpoints for health and tasks (CRUD operations). We'll use the Gorilla Mux router for minimal routing.
 2. Frontend: Let's choose React because it is widely used and has good documentation, but we can keep it very simple.
 3. Authentication: Basic token authentication using JWT for simplicity. However, note that the requirement says "keep it minimal", so we might use a simple session or token. We'll go with JWT tokens for stateless auth.
 4. Database: Use SQLite because it's lightweight and doesn't require separate setup.

 Let's break down:

 Backend:
   - Health check endpoint: /health
   - Tasks endpoints: 
        GET /tasks -> list tasks
        POST /tasks -> create task
        PUT /tasks/{id} -> update task
        DELETE /tasks/{id} -> delete task

 We'll use the following structure for a task (for simplicity, just id, title, description, and completed):
   type Task struct {
       ID          string `json:"id"`
       Title       string `json:"title"`
       Description string `json:"description"`
       Completed   bool   `json:"completed"`
   }

 We'll use the gorilla/mux router and a JWT middleware for authentication.

 However, note: The requirement says minimal. So we might not want to overcomplicate.
 Let's consider using a simple in-memory store first? But then we need persistence. Since it's SQLite, let's set up an SQLite database and use a GORM-like ORM (but minimal). We can use the standard library for DB operations if needed.

 Alternatively, we can use a small ORM like "github.com/jinzhu/gorm" but note that the requirement is to keep it simple and minimal. Let me check: The spec says choose one between SQLite or Postgres. Since Go has good support for both with GORM, I'll go with SQLite because it's easier.

 But wait, if we are building a minimum viable product (MVP), maybe in-memory would be enough? However, the requirement includes DB and containerization, so let's use SQLite.

 We'll create:
   - A Go HTTP server that uses Mux.
   - Models for Task with GORM (SQLite).
   - JWT authentication middleware. We can generate a simple token on login and then require it for other endpoints.

 Let me outline the backend:

 1. Import necessary packages: net/http, gorilla/mux, gorm, _/github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3, etc.
 2. Define Task struct with GORM tags.
 3. Set up database connection (SQLite) and auto migrate the task model.
 4. Create a JWT middleware that checks for a valid token in the Authorization header.
 5. Implement handlers for each endpoint.

 However, note: The requirement says minimal. We might not need full ORM if we are just doing CRUD. But let's keep it simple with GORM because it will handle the database interactions and migrations easily.

 For JWT, we can use a library like "github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go". We'll create a simple login endpoint that returns a token (with hardcoded credentials for now) and then protect the tasks endpoints.

 But wait, minimal auth: maybe just a secret key? Let's do:

   - A /login endpoint that accepts username and password. If they are correct (hardcoded), return a JWT token.
   - Then require an Authorization header with Bearer token for all task operations.

 However, note that the spec says "basic session or token". We can interpret it as having a simple way to authenticate without complex setup.

 Let's do:

   - /login: POST request with form data (username and password). If correct, return JWT token.
   - Then use this token for subsequent requests in tasks endpoints.

 But note: This is just an example. In production, you would want more secure auth.

 Now, let's write the backend code structure:

 We'll have:
   main.go
   handlers/tasks.go (or a single file with multiple functions)

 However, to keep it minimal and in one snippet if possible? The problem says "minimum viable code snippets", so we can break into multiple files but note that we are generating Go code.

 Since the requirement is for a Dockerfile and CI suggestion as well, I'll write:

   - main.go (with router setup)
   - task_model.go (if using GORM)

 But let's try to keep it in one file if possible? Or two. However, the instructions say "working, concise examples", so maybe we can do everything in one file.

 Let me structure the backend code in one file:

   package main

   import (
       // ... other imports
   )

   type Task struct {
       ID          string `gorm:"primaryKey" json:"id"`
       Title       string `json:"title"`
       Description string `json:"description"`
       Completed   bool   `json:"completed"`
   }

   var db *gorm.DB

   func main() {
       // Setup database
       // Initialize router
       r := mux.NewRouter()
       // Apply middleware to protected routes
       // Register handlers
       // Start server
   }

 But note: We are using JWT, so we need a way to generate and validate tokens.

 Let's create:

   - A secret key (hardcoded for now)
   - A function to create token (login handler will use this)
   - Middleware that checks the Authorization header

 However, let me think about the frontend. We'll have two pages: one for login and then a dashboard with tasks.

 Since we are using React, we can do:

   - Create a simple React app with two components: Login and TaskList.
   - Use fetch to call the backend endpoints.

 But note: The requirement says minimal. So let's keep the frontend very basic.

 Alternatively, if we choose Svelte, it might be even simpler? However, I'll stick with React because it has more tutorials and is widely used.

 Let me write a simple React app structure:

   - Create a new directory for frontend.
   - Use create-react-app or just set up minimal files (index.html, App.js, Login.js, TaskList.js).

 But the problem says "simple", so maybe we don't need to use create-react-app? We can have static HTML and JS.

 However, let's assume we are using React with a simple setup. I'll write:

   - index.html
   - src/App.js (with routing)
   - src/Login.js
   - src/Tasks.js

 But note: The backend must be running on the same host or CORS enabled? We can set up CORS in Go.

 Let's proceed step by step, but remember we are generating code snippets. I'll try to keep it as concise as possible.

 Since this is a text-based response and we cannot write multiple files at once, I will break down:

   Backend (Go):
     - main.go with the following:
         * Import statements
         * Task struct definition
         * Database setup (SQLite) using GORM
         * JWT secret key (hardcoded)
         * Middleware for JWT authentication
         * Handlers for tasks and health

   Frontend (React):
     - We'll create a simple React app with two components: Login and Tasks.
     - Use fetch to call the backend.

   Dockerfile:
     - Build the Go app and the React app separately, then combine them in one container? Or two containers?
     - The spec says containerize with Docker. It doesn't specify if it's one or multiple. Let me think: We can have a multi-stage build for both frontend and backend.

   CI suggestion:
     - Use GitHub Actions to build and test the Go app, and another for React tests? Or just suggest how to set up CI/CD.

 However, note that we are generating code snippets, so I'll try to write minimal working examples in each part.

 Let's start with the backend:

 We need to install:
   - Gorilla Mux: `go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux`
   - GORM for SQLite: `go get -u gorm.io/gorm` and `go get -u gorm.io/driver/sqlite`

 But note: The requirement is minimal, so maybe we don't need a full ORM? We can use the standard library. However, let's stick with GORM because it simplifies CRUD.

 Alternatively, if we are doing minimal, we might not even use an ORM and just do raw SQL. Let me adjust:

   - Use the standard library for DB operations to keep it more Go-native and less dependencies.

 But then again, GORM is popular and easy. However, let's consider that the requirement says "minimal", so maybe avoid extra libraries? We can write simple CRUD functions with sql.DB.

 I'll choose raw SQL because we are keeping minimal and also SQLite driver for Go is standard (github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3). But note: GORM might be easier for migrations, but let's do without ORM to keep it minimal.

 Let me change the plan:

   Backend:
     - Use `database/sql` and `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`
     - Define a Task struct.
     - Write functions to handle CRUD operations (using prepared statements).

   Steps in Go backend:

     1. Import necessary packages.
     2. Open SQLite database.
     3. Create table if not exists.
     4. Implement handlers for tasks and health.

 Let's write the main.go file accordingly.

 However, note: We are using JWT authentication. So we need to handle tokens.

 I'll create:

   - A /login endpoint that returns a token (if credentials are correct).
   - Then use this token in subsequent requests by including it in the Authorization


# 04-Test Output (generated in 9m20.243s)

<think>
We are going to generate code for:
 1. Go backend with SQLite and JWT auth.
 2. React frontend with two components: Login and TaskList.

 Let's start with the Go backend:

 We'll create a simple HTTP server that uses Mux, handles CORS (to allow requests from the frontend), and has endpoints for health and tasks (with authentication).

 Steps in main.go:
   - Import packages.
   - Define Task struct.
   - Open SQLite database and create table if not exists.
   - Implement JWT middleware (using a simple secret key).
   - Implement handlers: 
        * /health
        * /login (returns token)
        * /tasks (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with auth.

 We'll use the following for JWT:
   - Generate a token using jwt-go library.
   - The token will be in the format "Bearer <token>".

 Let's write the code:

 Note: This is a minimal example and not suitable for production without proper security measures (like storing secret key securely, etc.)

 Now, let's generate the Go code first.
</think>
### **Compact Test Plan**

#### 1. **Unit Tests**
   - Verify task CRUD operations in isolation.
   - Check JWT token validation logic.

#### 2. **API Contract Tests**
   - Validate endpoint behavior and responses using curl examples.

#### 3. **Integration/Functional Tests**
   - Test the full flow (login, create/update/delete tasks).

### **Go Unit Tests**

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"net/http"
	"testing"

	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestMain(t *testing.M) {
	// Initialize in-memory DB for tests
	setupTestDB()
	
	// Run all tests

		assert.NotNil(t, task.CreatedAt)
	}
}

// Test helper to execute handlers and check responses
func executeHandler(handler http.HandlerFunc) *http.Response {
	req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", "/tasks", nil)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	
	rr := httprunner.NewRunner()
	handler.ServeHTTP(rr, req)
	return rr.Result()
}

// Test login endpoint (returns JWT token)
func TestLogin(t *testing.T) {

		Token string `json:"token"`
	}
	err = json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&token)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("Error decoding response: %v", err)
	}

	assert.NotEmpty(t, token.Token)
}
```

### **API Contract Tests (curl examples)**

#### 1. **GET /tasks**
```bash
# Get all tasks with valid auth header
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
     http://localhost:8080/tasks

# Unauthorized access (should return 401)
curl -H "Authorization: InvalidToken" \
     http://localhost:8080/tasks
```

#### 2. **POST /tasks**
```bash
# Create a new task with valid auth
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
     -d '{"title":"Test Task", "description":"This is a test"}' \
     http://localhost:8080/tasks
```

#### 3. **PUT /tasks/{id}**
```bash
# Update task with valid auth (mark as completed)
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"completed": true}' \
     http://localhost:8080/tasks/1234567890abcdef
```

#### 4. **DELETE /tasks/{id}**
```bash
# Delete task with valid auth
curl -X DELETE \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
     http://localhost:8080/tasks/1234567890abcdef
```

### **Frontend Setup**

#### React Example (`App.js`):
```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function App() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);
  const [newTask, setNewTask] = useState({ title: '', description: '' });

  // Fetch tasks with auth token (stored in localStorage)
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchTasks = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:8080/tasks', {
          headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}` }
        });
        setTasks(response.data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
      }
    };
    fetchTasks();
  }, []);

  // Handle task creation
  const handleCreateTask = async () => {
    try {
      await axios.post('http://localhost:8080/tasks', newTask, {
        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}` }
      });
      // Refresh tasks list after successful creation
      fetchTasks();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Tasks</h1>
      <ul>{tasks.map(task => <li key={task.id}>{task.title}</li>)}</ul>
      {/* Input fields for new task */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

### **Key Notes**
- The Go unit tests assume a test database setup (not shown here).
- Adjust the `go build` command if using environment variables or flags.
- For frontend testing, consider tools like Jest and React Testing Library.
