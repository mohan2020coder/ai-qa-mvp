Context: Task Management Web App
=============================

### Overview

The task management web app is designed to provide a simple and efficient way for individuals and teams to manage their tasks, set reminders, and collaborate in real-time. The system will be built using Go as the backend language, React or Svelte for the frontend framework, basic session or token authentication, SQLite or Postgres for the database, and Docker for containerization.

### Components

1. **Backend**: The backend component will handle all the server-side logic, including CRUD operations for tasks, user authentication, and task reminders. It will be built using Go and will communicate with the frontend component through RESTful APIs.
2. **Frontend**: The frontend component will provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system. It will be built using React or Svelte and will communicate with the backend component through RESTful APIs.
3. **Auth**: The auth component will handle user authentication and authorization. It will be built using basic session or token authentication and will communicate with the backend component through RESTful APIs.
4. **DB**: The DB component will store all the data for the system, including tasks, users, and reminders. It will be built using SQLite or Postgres and will communicate with the backend component through SQL queries.
5. **Containerization**: The system will be containerized using Docker, which will allow us to easily deploy the application on different environments and platforms. We will also include a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.

### Sequence for Key Flows

1. User creates a new task in the frontend component and submits it to the backend component through RESTful APIs.
2. The backend component validates the input data, creates a new task in the DB component, and sends a response back to the frontend component.
3. The frontend component displays the new task in the user's task list.
4. User sets a reminder for the task in the frontend component and submits it to the backend component through RESTful APIs.
5. The backend component updates the reminder date in the DB component and sends a response back to the frontend component.
6. The frontend component displays the updated reminder date for the task.
7. Team lead creates a new task for their team in the frontend component and submits it to the backend component through RESTful APIs.
8. The backend component validates the input data, creates a new task in the DB component, and sends a response back to the frontend component.
9. The frontend component displays the new task in the team lead's task list.
10. Team lead sets a reminder for the task in the frontend component and submits it to the backend component through RESTful APIs.
11. The backend component updates the reminder date in the DB component and sends a response back to the frontend component.
12. The frontend component displays the updated reminder date for the task.

### API Spec Outline

The following is an outline of the RESTful APIs that will be used by the system:

1. **GET /tasks**: Retrieves a list of all tasks for the current user or team lead.
2. **POST /tasks**: Creates a new task and adds it to the DB component.
3. **PUT /tasks/{task_id}**: Updates an existing task in the DB component.
4. **DELETE /tasks/{task_id}**: Deletes an existing task from the DB component.
5. **GET /reminders**: Retrieves a list of all reminders for the current user or team lead.
6. **POST /reminders**: Creates a new reminder and adds it to the DB component.
7. **PUT /reminders/{reminder_id}**: Updates an existing reminder in the DB component.
8. **DELETE /reminders/{reminder_id}**: Deletes an existing reminder from the DB component.

### Data Model

The following is a high-level data model for the system:

1. Tasks: Each task will have a unique ID, title, description, status (e.g., "in progress", "completed"), and reminder date.
2. Reminders: Each reminder will have a unique ID, task ID, user ID, and reminder date.
3. Users: Each user will have a unique ID, username, email, and password.
4. Teams: Each team will have a unique ID, name, and list of members (user IDs).

### Tradeoffs

1. **Scalability**: The system will be designed to scale horizontally by adding more instances of the backend component as needed.
2. **Performance**: The system will use caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce the load on the DB component.
3. **Security**: The system will use basic session or token authentication to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Error Handling**: The system will have good error handling in place to recover from unexpected errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.
5. **Documentation**: The system will have good documentation and support for users and developers, including API documentation and user guides.
