Here is a compact test plan and example tests for the task management web app:

1. Unit Tests (Go):
	* Test that the backend service can handle HTTP requests correctly.
	* Test that the database connection is established successfully.
	* Test that the CRUD operations on tasks are working as expected.
2. API Contract Tests (curl examples):
	* Test that the `/health` endpoint returns a 200 status code and "OK" response body.
	* Test that the `/tasks` endpoint returns a list of tasks for a specific user ID.
	* Test that the `/tasks/create`, `/tasks/update`, and `/tasks/delete` endpoints can create, update, and delete tasks correctly.
3. CI Outline:
	* Set up a GitHub Actions pipeline to deploy the Docker image to Docker Hub.
	* Configure the pipeline to run on push events for the `main` branch.
	* Use the `docker build` and `docker push` commands in the pipeline to build and deploy the Docker image.

Here are some example tests:

1. Unit Tests (Go):
```go
package main

import (
	"testing"
)

func TestBackendService(t *testing.T) {
	// Set up a test server
	server := httptest.NewServer(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "OK")
	}))
	defer server.Close()

	// Test that the server can handle HTTP requests correctly
	resp, err := http.Get(server.URL + "/health")
	if err != nil {
		t.Errorf("Failed to get response: %v", err)
	}
	if resp.StatusCode != 200 {
		t.Errorf("Expected status code 200, got %d", resp.StatusCode)
	}
	body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	if string(body) != "OK" {
		t.Errorf("Expected response body 'OK', got '%s'", body)
	}
}
```
2. API Contract Tests (curl examples):
```bash
# Test that the /health endpoint returns a 200 status code and "OK" response body
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/health
{"status":"OK"}

# Test that the /tasks endpoint returns a list of tasks for a specific user ID
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/tasks?user_id=1
[{"id":1,"title":"Task 1","description":"Description 1","status":"active","reminder_date":"2023-03-15T14:30:00Z"},{"id":2,"title":"Task 2","description":"Description 2","status":"completed","reminder_date":"2023-03-16T14:30:00Z"}]

# Test that the /tasks/create endpoint can create a new task correctly
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/tasks/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Task 3","description":"Description 3","status":"active","reminder_date":"2023-03-17T14:30:00Z"}'
{"id":3,"title":"Task 3","description":"Description 3","status":"active","reminder_date":"2023-03-17T14:30:00Z"}

# Test that the /tasks/update endpoint can update a task correctly
$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/tasks/update \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":3,"title":"Task 3 updated","description":"Description 3 updated","status":"completed","reminder_date":"2023-03-17T14:30:00Z"}'
{"id":3,"title":"Task 3 updated","description":"Description 3 updated","status":"completed","reminder_date":"2023-03-17T14:30:00Z"}

# Test that the /tasks/delete endpoint can delete a task correctly
$ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/tasks/delete?id=3
{"message":"Task deleted successfully"}
```
